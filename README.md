# Image Captioning Model

This repository contains an Image Captioning model developed using the [MS COCO dataset](https://cocodataset.org/). The model generates descriptive captions for images by combining deep learning techniques in computer vision and natural language processing.

## Features
- **Image Feature Extraction**: Utilizes a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) (e.g., ResNet, InceptionV3) to extract image features.
- **Sequence Modeling**: Employs a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), specifically an LSTM, for generating captions based on extracted image features.
- **End-to-End Training**: Trains both the image feature extractor and the caption generator in an integrated manner.
- **Custom Tokenizer**: Implements a tokenizer to preprocess and vectorize captions.

## Dataset
The model is trained on the [MS COCO dataset](https://cocodataset.org/), a large-scale dataset containing images and their corresponding annotations. It includes diverse objects and scenes, making it ideal for image captioning tasks.

### Dataset Preparation
1. Download the MS COCO dataset (images and annotations).
2. Preprocess images: Resize and normalize.
3. Tokenize and pad captions.
4. Split data into training, validation, and testing sets.

## Model Architecture
1. **Encoder (CNN)**: Extracts feature vectors from images using a pre-trained model (e.g., ResNet or InceptionV3).
2. **Decoder (LSTM)**: Generates captions by taking the image feature vectors and the previous word as input.
3. **Attention Mechanism**: (Optional) Highlights specific parts of the image while generating captions.
